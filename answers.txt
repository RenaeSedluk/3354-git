(a) How many commits exist in the repository history after completing step 8?
7 commits, the 8th commit was commting Answers.txt before adding it to the repository.
(b) When was the file .gitignore added?

(c) What is the difference between git log and git status?
Git log shows a log of the different commits, their subject like body. Git status checks this branch (which happens to be master) and compares if it is up to date against the origin/master. It also states if there is anything that needs to be commited. 
(d) What is the difference between unstaged and untracked files?
Untracked are not in Git, while unstaged are in git but not marked for commit. Staged changes are in Git and marked for commit.
(e) What is the difference between git checkout and git reset?
git checkout allows you to check out a new or existing branch, so that work can be done on a branch and merged with master later. Git reset reverts that branch back to the master, aka wiping away any unsaved work. 
(f) What happens if you try to pull remote changes when there are uncommitted
changes in your working directory?
You will not be able to, you will be asked to commit before you pull.
